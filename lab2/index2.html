			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For beginners like us, the syntax and usage of HTML and CSS may be unfamiliar and uncomfortable, requiring more practice and reference to sample code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When we encounter unfamiliar places, we promptly refer to the examples in canvas, which is a good learning method. At the same time, we also learned 
					how to check our own codes and a practical debugging technique.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think we demonstrated a good attitude of serious learning and mutual cooperation in this task.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Overall, we demonstrated a good learning and collaborative attitude in this introductory exercise on HTML and CSS, and successfully completed the task.
					 I hope we can continue to work hard and make greater progress in our subsequent course studies.</p>
