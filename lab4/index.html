			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this assignment, the main challenge is to break down a complete "Rock paper scissors" Game into clear steps and
					logic, and express it in the form of pseudocoding and annotations. This requires a deep understanding of the rules and
					processes of the game, as well as strong abstract and logical thinking abilities.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>In the process of decomposing game steps, I found that some steps can be further subdivided to make the logic clearer.
					For example, the step of "starting a game turn" can be subdivided into sub steps such as "player input selection",
					"computer-generated selection", "judging turn results", etc.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Through this assignment, I have gained a deeper understanding of how to break down a complex problem into smaller and
					more manageable sub problems. I realized that good problem decomposition and structured thinking are the foundation for
					writing clear and effective code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The following is a summary of the main steps of Simple "Rock paper scissors" Game:
						<ul>
						<li>1. Display game menu: Display the game menu to the player and prompt them to start a new game or exit the game.</li>
						<li>2. Initialize the game: Set the scores of both the player and the computer to 0 to prepare for the game.</li>
						<li>3. Start game round: The player chooses to punch, the computer randomly generates a selection, and then judges the
						turn result according to the game rules, and updates the score accordingly.</li>
						<li>4. Determine if the game end condition have been met: Check whether the player or computer's score has reached the
						winning score, and if so, the game ends; If not, start a new turn.</li>
						<li>5. Display the final game result: Display the final score and announce the winner.</li>
						<li>6. Return to Game Menu: After the game is over, return to the game menu where players can choose to start a new 
						game or exit the game.</li></p>
						</ul>
